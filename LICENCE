King James Bible 1611
=====================

The commissioning of the King James Bible took place at a conference at the 
Hampton Court Palace in London England in 1604. When King James came to the 
throne he wanted unity and stability in the church and state, but was well aware 
that the diversity of his constituents had to be considered. There were the 
Papists who longed for the English church to return to the Roman Catholic fold 
and the Latin Vulgate. There were Puritans, loyal to the crown but wanting even 
more distance from Rome. The Puritans used the Geneva Bible which contained 
footnotes that the king regarded as seditious. The Traditionalists made up of 
Bishops of the Anglican Church wanted to retain the Bishops Bible.

The king commissioned a new English translation to be made by over fifty 
scholars representing the Puritans and Traditionalists. They took into 
consideration: the Tyndale New Testament, the Matthews Bible, the Great Bible 
and the Geneva Bible. The great revision of the Bible had begun. From 1605 to 
1606 the scholars engaged in private research. From 1607 to 1609 the work was 
assembled. In 1610 the work went to press, and in 1611 the first of the huge (16 
inch tall) pulpit folios known today as "The 1611 King James Bible" came off the 
printing press.
